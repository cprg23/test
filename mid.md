definitely dropping that bum McAvoy
which would an easy give 59 point bump
defense 3
drop Charlie McAvoy (D) BOS
add Zach Werenski (D) CBJ
```

```

thinking about these two forwards or 
maybe goalie Connor Hellebuyck (G) WPG
which would add another 80 points or so

forward 7
drop Verhaeghe, C (FLA) (F)
add Lucas Raymond (RW) DET

forward 8
drop Hischier, N (NJD) (F)
add Connor, K (WPG) (F)
```
